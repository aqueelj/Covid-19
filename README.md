# Covid-19
Report summarizing cases of Covid-19 in the U.S. along with other useful information

This is a report created in PowerBI desktop which has a minimal interface that easily conveys information regarding the cases, deaths,
recoveries and hospitalizations in different states in the US. The data has been scraped online and is updated periodically as the sources are
updated. 

Note: The docx file displays screenshots that give a brief idea about the interface. The pbix file may not display the visuals as the source
formats are changed periodically and that requires changes at the power query level.
